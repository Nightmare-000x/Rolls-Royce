<h3>Rolls-Royce grew from the electrical and mechanical business established by Henry Royce in 1884.
Royce built his first motor car in 1904 and in May of that year met Charles Rolls,
whose company sold quality cars in London.</h3>

<li>1906</li>
</ul>
<p>Success with the cars led to the formation of the Rolls-Royce company in March 1906 and
   to the launch of the six-cylinder Silver Ghost which,
   within a year, was hailed as 'the best car in the world'.</p>

   <h4>At the start of the First World War, in response to the nation's needs, Royce designed his first aero engine – the Eagle, providing some half of the total horsepower used in the air war by the allies.
The Eagle powered the first direct transatlantic flight as well as the first flight from England to Australia – both in the Vickers Vimy aircraft.</h4>
